      <h5>Final Project</h5>
      <p>For the dissertation Sulman needed to create a game that would test humans in a very high-profile situation where decision making needed to be made with precision, and to ultimately had to create a game using the unity game engine that could test users in such a manner. The focus of the game was to test human response in different situations, the way he was able to portray this, was to make the user follow a horror themed-story in which they would be given certain options to make the story more subjective to them, based on what they chose. They could listen to the advice given from the NPC’s or completely ignore it. The user would progress through the story and different options would have different outcomes some leading to a either a good or bad end. </p>
